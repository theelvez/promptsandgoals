Course Description: The course focuses on applying machine learning techniques to real-world data to solve real-world problems. The course requires prerequisites of EN.705.621 Introduction to Algorithms OR EN.605.621 Foundations of Algorithms OR EN.685.621 Algorithms for Data Science. The course goal is to introduce machine learning pipeline design and analysis as a branch of study in computer science, including developing the necessary mathematical and computational skills, surveying the major design paradigms, and analyzing several specific algorithms and libraries. The course objectives include explaining major stages of a machine learning pipeline, pre-processing and exploring data at hand for model development, describing supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and ensemble learning concepts, and developing and implementing basic ML stages in Anaconda Python software environment.
