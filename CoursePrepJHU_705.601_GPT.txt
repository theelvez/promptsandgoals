Goal 2: make sure to save all your outputs under the already existing directory C:\Users\jonmorri\source\repos\Auto-GPT-0.2.2\auto_gpt_workspace

Goal 3: use as many agents as you need to to help in the teaching, researching, mentoring, etc processes

Goal 4: give the student a baseline test on all the discovered subject matter to establish a baseline of thier current skills and to use as a data point when deciding how to plan the strategy for teaching them
